# fisc_pol_hank
Repository for the reproduction of the figures in my master thesis "Public Policy through the Lens of Heterogeneous-Agents Models with Frictions".

For the reproduction, install the environment by running in conda:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then make sure you use the installed environment

```bash
conda activate thesis_loresdiz
```

and run main.py

The process will take some minutes, then all results will be produced.
